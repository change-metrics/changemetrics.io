title: Version 1.2.1 Release
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of Monocle:

Two days ago we released the version 1.2.0 followed today by a corrective release 1.2.1.

Here is a summary of notable changes:

- Ability to filter changes by tags. Tags are GitHub labels, Gerrit hashtags and topic and GitLab labels.
- The Gerrit crawler has been migrated from Python to Haskell and now benefits the new crawler API.
- The contrib/ directory contains two examples of Monocle API usage using Python.
- Some keywords of the Monocle query language have been renamed for clarity. 

Notice that the crawler and api containers are now based on a recent version of Fedora 35 that requires a recent Docker (>= 20.10.3).

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and
the [backlog](https://github.com/change-metrics/monocle/issues) for what's coming next.
